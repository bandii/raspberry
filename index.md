# This is only a Pet Project

This is a small documentation about how I set up my Raspberry PI for my home projects. It helps to find out what did I set up and when.

## // TODO:
- [ ] Docker UI
- [ ] Add Service-Mesh
- [ ] ArgoCD or Flux?
- [ ] Move the portainer to k3s

- [ ] Set users and roles
- [ ] Add https with custom cert?
